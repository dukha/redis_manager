database on the server and 
a developer's redis database on the server

the application in development mode

Admin and Developers
*Every time a developer or admin enters adds a translation_item
is written then records with blank translation are written 
for all languages

Admin
*Everytime a new language is added all translation_items in English are 
copied with blank translation for the new language.

Translators
* Use a screen with dot_key_code and english translation 
and a field for the new translation item
* As each translation_item is written a record is created in 
the relational database. 

Admin
* Publish a language means write all translation_items from 
the relational database it to the redis database on the server.
